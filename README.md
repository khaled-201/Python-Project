# 🌍 Groundwater Contamination and Environmental Risk in California

## 📝 Description
This project explores groundwater contamination across California using data from the GeoTracker system. It focuses on identifying the most common types of contamination, analyzing regional differences, and uncovering how vulnerable communities (measured by CalEnviroScreen scores) are affected.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [GeoTracker - Groundwater Quality Regulatory Information](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ground-water-water-quality-regulatory-information)
- **File Used**: `geotracker_sites_2024-11-01.csv`
- The dataset includes over 75,000 records on contamination case types, cleanup status, location, and environmental risk scores.

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights
- **LUST (Leaking Underground Storage Tanks)** are the most common contamination type.
- Industrial pollution is also significant, labeled under **Cleanup Program Sites**.
- Communities with high **CalEnviroScreen** scores (≥70) experience more contamination, suggesting environmental injustice.
- Charts and plots reveal how contamination is distributed across case types and regions.
